# RSA Factoring Challenge

This section of the ALX Higher Level Programming sprint involves solving RSA Factoring Challenges. The objective is to factorize numbers into products of smaller numbers, with a specific emphasis on factoring numbers used in RSA encryption.

## About the ALX Software Engineering Program

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program, an intensive program designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to become proficient software engineers. It covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

### About the Author

This project is completed by Emmanuel Odenyire Anyira, a student at ALX Africa. Emmanuel is also a Senior Data Analytics Engineer at Safaricom PLC in Kenya, where he specializes in creating and optimizing data pipelines, performing ETL processes, and working with various data technologies.

Emmanuel's expertise includes Python, Apache Nifi, Informatica Powercenter, and IDMC for ETL processes. He is also expanding his skills in Julia, Scala, and R.

## Project Details

### Task 0: Factorize all the things!

In this task, the objective is to factorize as many numbers as possible into products of two smaller numbers. The input is provided via a file, with one number per line. The output format should be `n=p*q` where `p` and `q` are the factors.

Example:
```
4=2*2
12=6*2
34=17*2
128=64*2
...
```

### Task 1: RSA Factoring Challenge

The goal of this task is to factorize a single number into two prime numbers. Similar to Task 0, the input is provided via a file with one number. The output format should be `n=p*q`, where `p` and `q` are prime factors.

Example:
```
6=3*2
77=11*7
239821585064027=15486481*15485867
...
```
